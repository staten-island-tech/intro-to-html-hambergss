        Hi, my name is Amber and I go to Staten Island Technical High School. I like anime, manga, webtoons, kpop, and
        genshin but Im not a degenerate. Trust. Did you know that theres a new genshin update and theres as new region
        called Natlan, the pyro region so basically its amazing. Also not only that theres also a free standard 5 star
        with a bunch of bonus primos, ikr they're so generous arent they. Also stan seventeen. Trust it will make your
        life a lot more meaningful.
